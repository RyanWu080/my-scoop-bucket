Template bucket for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer.

## How do I use this template?

1. Generate your own copy of this repository with the "Use this template"
   button.
2. Allow all GitHub Actions:
   - Navigate to `Settings` - `Actions` - `General` - `Actions permissions`.
   - Select `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`.
   - Then `Save`.
3. Allow writing to the repository from within GitHub Actions:
   - Navigate to `Settings` - `Actions` - `General` - `Workflow permissions`.
   - Select `Read and write permissions`.
   - Then `Save`.
4. Document the bucket in `README.md`.
5. Replace the placeholder repository string in `bin/auto-pr.ps1`.
6. Create new manifests by copying `bucket/app-name.json.template` to
   `bucket/<app-name>.json`.
7. Commit and push changes.
8. If you'd like your bucket to be indexed on `https://scoop.sh`, add the
   topic `scoop-bucket` to your repository.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add <bucketname> https://github.com/<username>/<bucketname>
scoop install <bucketname>/<manifestname>
```

## PCL CE

```pwsh
scoop bucket add my-scoop-bucket https://github.com/RyanWu080/my-scoop-bucket
scoop install my-scoop-bucket/pclce
# Beta channel:
scoop install my-scoop-bucket/pclce-beta
```

Both packages support x64 and ARM64 and require .NET 10 Desktop Runtime.
If needed, run `scoop bucket add extras` and
`scoop install extras/windowsdesktop-runtime` to install the runtime.

The `pclce` and `pclce-beta` commands and Start Menu shortcuts are distinct.
Each package preserves its own `PCL` and `.minecraft` directories across updates.
Settings stored by the launcher in AppData may still be shared between channels.
Use Scoop for updates and disable automatic downloads in the launcher's update settings.
